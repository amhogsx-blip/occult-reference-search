  <h1>ABOUT US</h1>

  <p>What began in direct response to the undersea, unexplained, mass sponge migration of June 20, 1980, The Occult Reference Net (T.O.R.N.) was founded by an international community of detectives, scientists, and theologists to serve as an educational resource akin to, and medium between, Charles Darwin’s “On the Origin of Species (or, more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life)”, and the late John Horace Tobin’s “Spirit Guide (being a Compendium of Ghosts, Gods, Spirits, and Manifestations from Outside the Normal Realms of Existence, with a Travelogue and Notes on a Philosophy of the Occult)” to chart, track, and catalogue all things relating to, but not limited by, life, death, the occult, paranormal, strange and unusual.</p>

  <p>Following The Interdimensional Cross-Rip that occurred on November 9, 1984 on the rooftop of 55 Central Park West, New York, NY 10023, we believe it is imperative that we work together to prevent other potential disasters of biblical proportions.</p>

  <p>Today members of the T.O.R.N. community have helped make it one of the most well known, and respected, platforms on the net for the distribution of paranormal research and defense information.</p>

  <p>Topics of interest to you may include UFOs, astral projection, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full trance mediums, Bigfoot, gremlins, the Loch Ness monster, and the theory of Atlantis.</p>

  <p>Here you will also find alternative history, detailed guides regarding cranial trepanation, cryptid creatures and critters, demonic possession, exorcism, Hollow Earth, mood slime, pagan rituals, regional VooDoo practices, witchcraft, and zoological lycanthropy.</p>

  <p>However, you will not find any nonsensical propaganda supporting Anti-Vaccination, Flat Earth, Intelligent Design, politically motivated ideologies or any Moon Landing conspiracy theories.</p>

  <p>Be not afraid, for we bump back.</p>
